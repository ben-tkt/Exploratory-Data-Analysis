# Project 1: Foodhub Data Analysis

## 🎯 My Objectives
* To share my work
* Receive feedback on improving methods
* Serve as reference material for anyone trying to practice on data analytics

## 📓 Project Description 
* **Objective** - To apply the techniques learnt from python and perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in a real world industry problem.
* **Problem Statement** - Perform EDA to answer key questions and help the company to improve the business.
This project is my first capstone project under a data science coursework with MIT.
* **Data Source** - Provided by Great Learning as materials for the project.

## ℹ️ Data Dictionary
* order_id: Unique ID of the order
* customer_id: ID of the customer who ordered the food
* restaurant_name: Name of the restaurant
* cuisine_type: Cuisine ordered by the customer
* cost: Cost of the order
* day_of_the_week: Indicates whether the order is placed on a weekday or weekend (The weekday is from Monday to Friday and the weekend is Saturday and Sunday)
* rating: Rating given by the customer out of 5
* food_preparation_time: Time (in minutes) taken by the restaurant to prepare the food. This is calculated by taking the difference between the timestamps of the restaurant's order confirmation and the delivery person's pick-up confirmation.
* delivery_time: Time (in minutes) taken by the delivery person to deliver the food package. This is calculated by taking the difference between the timestamps of the delivery person's pick-up confirmation and drop-off information

## 📓Key Features Used
* Libraries used - Numpy, Pandas, Scipy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
* Software used - Python programming, Google Colab

## 📓 Techniques used
* **Cleaning data** from missing data, duplicated data and outliers
* **Feature Engineering** such as One-hot Encoding and Data Binning
* **Data visualization** using seaborn plots
* **Exploratory Data Analysis** (Univariate and multivariate)
